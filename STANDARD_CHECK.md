# A standard check for statement review

Working notes and a proposal, July 2026. None of this is built into
formal-conjectures yet; I'm collecting feedback from its maintainers first.
Discussion: [leanprover Zulip, #Formal conjectures](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/524981-Formal-conjectures).

## The problem

Merging a conjecture statement into
[formal-conjectures](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures)
requires a maintainer to read it carefully against the source. Yaël Dillies
put numbers on it: about ten minutes per problem, a ~200-hour lower bound for
the Erdős corpus alone. Reviewers currently spend many of those minutes on
things a machine or the author could have caught first, instead of on the one
question that actually needs a person: does the formal statement say what the
problem says?

Most review comments are repetitive. Moritz Firsching: "pretty much what we
write during review is repetitive and should just be in a checklist for the
Author or their agents to tick off." Meanwhile faithfulness, the property
reviewers are really there to judge, is invisible to the toolchain. A
statement can elaborate, pass every linter, and still be wrong by meaning;
when the miniF2F benchmark was re-audited
([arXiv:2511.03108](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03108)), over half of its
type-checking statements turned out to disagree with their informal
originals.

The design rule throughout is the one this repository's signed frontier
already runs on: mechanical checks can gate, model output never does.
Machines report facts and a named human signs the judgment.

## Overview

| layer | what it does | run by | can it block a merge? | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| author checklist | recurring review corrections, ticked off before review | author (or their agent) | no | open as [FC#4378](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/pull/4378) |
| statement facts | one CI comment: attributes, status agreement, axiom/hypothesis audit of linked proofs | deterministic CI | no | proposed |
| behavioral probes | prover run + suspicious-pattern linters, flags only | deterministic CI | no | proposed |
| screening check | model-assisted per-clause review, curated by a person, transcript published | a person running a model | no | format documented below |
| signature | reads the mathematics, approves, signs | maintainer / named reviewer | **yes, the only thing that does** | unchanged |

## The layers

**The author's checklist.** A "Before requesting review" section in
`FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/README.md`, collected from corrections that
keep coming up in review: quote erdosproblems.com verbatim instead of
paraphrasing, and for solved problems also quote the attribution sentence
below the box; search `FormalConjecturesForMathlib` and neighboring files
before defining anything; keep notes-to-reviewers in the PR description; give
new attribute behavior demo tests. Every line traces to a review comment on a
merged PR. It needs no infrastructure, and the welcome bot already points
contributors at the README.

**Statement facts, computed in CI.** One comment per ErdosProblems PR, edited
in place on each push (mathlib's `PR_summary` pattern; posting a new comment
per run is how review bots get disabled). What it reports:

| fact | source |
|---|---|
| category, AMS tag, docstring per declaration | the repo's own linters, surfaced per-PR |
| does the file's category agree with erdosproblems.com's live status | `scripts/check_erdos_status.py`, already in the repo |
| for each `formal_proof` link: axiom set, sorry state, Prop hypotheses taken as parameters | the extractor behind this repository's audit and [FC#4368](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/pull/4368) |

This is the mechanical half of a review, done before the reviewer arrives.
[FC#3973](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/issues/3973)
asks for the same class of metadata check in CI, and
[FC#4367](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/pull/4367)
builds status-fixing on the same drift detector; all three could feed one
comment.

**Behavioral probes.** Asking a model to compare the statement with its
source catches less than trying to use the statement. When the
[Faithfulness Gap paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16541) measured LLM
judges on statement drift, they caught 63% of it; probes that act on the
statement caught about 90%. Two probes look worth having here. First, run a
prover briefly against the statement and against its negation. A genuinely
open problem survives both, and a statement missing a hypothesis usually
does not: Boris Alexeev
[ran Aristotle against Erdős 56](https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2025/12/05/formalization-of-erdos-problems/)
and a size-2 counterexample exposed the missing hypothesis. Second, extend
the repo's own suspicious-pattern linters. `ExistsImplicationLinter` and
`AnswerLinter` already catch two misformalization shapes at elaboration time,
and the same mold fits vacuous hypotheses and trivially-true goals. A probe
result is a flag for the reviewer, not a verdict.

**The screening check.** For contested or high-stakes statements: the
procedure Nat Sothanaphan developed for solution claims on erdosproblems.com,
adapted to statement fidelity. I reconstructed it from his forum posts, so
corrections are welcome, especially from him.

| step | rule | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | fresh model session, every time | a model sharing context with whoever produced the statement is convinced by its own reading |
| 2 | overview → rank the riskiest spots (quantifier order, hypothesis strength, definitional unfolding) → audit each → one full pass | ranking risks produces careful scrutiny; a "be adversarial" instruction produces hallucinated errors |
| 3 | per-clause table: every quantifier, hypothesis, and conclusion mapped to source text, one verdict per clause | mismatches hide in single clauses; after correcting any misreading, re-verify **every** clause |
| 4 | say the check "**found** no mismatch" or "**claimed** a mismatch in clause X", never "the statement is faithful" | positive error reports are themselves unverified claims |
| 5 | publish the transcript, with the standing disclaimer: a screening, not comprehensive, not a confirmation stamp | anyone can audit the prompt and the reasoning behind a verdict |

Known ways this fails, and the guard for each:

| failure mode | evidence | guard |
|---|---|---|
| the model confirms whatever artifact is in front of it | [BrokenMath](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04721): 29% sycophantic-proof rate, best model tested | ask what does *not* match, never "verify this is right" |
| independent runs share blind spots | [FrontierMath v2 audit](https://epoch.ai/frontiermath/the-benchmark): errors in 42% of problems that had passed human review | take the union of flags and have a human adjudicate each; no majority voting |
| circularity | models citing the site's own status as evidence a problem is open | the check reads the original source, never the repo's docstring |
| one clause corrected, the rest assumed fine | Nat's Chojecki case: a fixed misreading, and the already-passed clause never re-checked | step 3's re-verify-all rule |

**The signature.** Maintainer approval stays the only thing that merges a
statement. In this repository's terms, a statement-fidelity verdict exists
only as a named reviewer's signed event. None of the layers above signs
anything.

## The CI problem, measured

Most of the time a PR spends waiting on CI buys it nothing.
`build-and-docs.yml` serves both PR validation and site deployment with one
job, so the deploy half runs on every PR even though only main deploys. Step
timings from two recent PR runs (28612552108 and 28608145267; 100 and 115
minutes total):

| step | time | needed for a PR? |
|---|---|---|
| `lake --wfail build` (the actual gate) | ~28 min | yes |
| Verso literate source pages | 52–53 min | no, deployed only from main |
| doc-gen documentation | 7–31 min, cache luck | no |
| growth plots, stats, website build, Pages artifact | ~5 min | no |

Roughly two thirds of every PR's CI goes to artifacts the PR can never
deploy, and the workflow runs 100+ times a week.

Moritz is already working on part of this:
[FC#4302](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/pull/4302)
removes docgen outright, citing its build time. The run data says #4302
helps but doesn't fix the PR lane on its own. Verso literate is the dominant
per-PR cost at 52–53 minutes every run, docgen the smaller one, and
[FC#4306](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/issues/4306)
would extend Verso to `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`, which grows it. The two
changes fit together: #4302 decides which doc artifacts exist, gating decides
when they build. With both, PR CI lands around 30 minutes however the
docgen-versus-Verso question resolves.

Caching makes the remaining third slower than it should be. The repository
sits at GitHub's 10 GB cache ceiling with LRU eviction, and every PR run
saves olean and doc caches under `refs/pull/N/merge`, a scope no other PR
can read. Dozens of unreadable PR-scoped entries evict the main-branch
caches that every run actually restores from, which would explain both the
28-minute "incremental" build and the 7-versus-31-minute spread on doc
builds.

Two workflow conditions fix it: build the literate/docs/website/artifact
steps only when the ref is main, and save caches only from main while
restoring everywhere. PR CI drops from ~100 to ~30 minutes, and the build
step should fall further once main's caches stop being evicted.

## Rollout

| phase | what | needs | decided by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | README checklist ([FC#4378](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/pull/4378), open) + screening-format self-reviews on my own open batch PRs | a read | do the artifacts save cycles? |
| CI split | gate deploy-only steps off PRs, save caches from main only | one workflow review; composes with [FC#4302](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/pull/4302) | the run timings above |
| 2 | statement-facts comment behind a `statement-check` label, ~10 PRs | a label | review cycles per merged PR vs recent baseline |
| 3 | probes, one at a time | phase 2 paying for itself | a hit-rate ledger per probe |

Any check that keeps flagging things nobody acts on gets removed.
