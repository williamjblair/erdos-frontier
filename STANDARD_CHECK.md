# A standard check for statement review

**Status: proposal.** Written 2026-07-02, seeking feedback from the
formal-conjectures maintainers before any of it is built. Discussion:
[leanprover Zulip, #Formal conjectures](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/524981-Formal-conjectures).

## The problem

Merging a conjecture statement into
[formal-conjectures](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures)
requires a maintainer to read it carefully against the source. Yaël Dillies
put numbers on it: roughly ten minutes per problem, a ~200-hour lower bound
for the Erdős corpus alone. The variable worth optimizing is **maintainer
review cycles per merged statement**: every round trip a reviewer spends on
something a machine or the author could have caught is a round trip not spent
on the one judgment that needs them, whether the formal statement faithfully
states the problem.

Two facts shape the design. First, most review comments are repetitive;
Moritz Firsching: "pretty much what we write during review is repetitive and
should just be in a checklist for the Author or their agents to tick off."
Second, faithfulness is exactly the property the toolchain does not check: a
statement can elaborate, pass every linter, and be wrong by meaning. The
miniF2F re-audit ([arXiv:2511.03108](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03108)) found
informal/formal discrepancies in over half of a benchmark's type-checking
statements.

## Principles

1. **Mechanical checks may gate; model output never does.** No LLM judgment
   becomes repo state, blocks a merge, or is reported as a verdict. This
   matches how every mature review bot converged (advisory commentary,
   deterministic gates) and how this repo's signed frontier already works:
   machines report facts, a named human signs judgment.
2. **One sticky comment per PR, edited in place.** The mathlib
   `PR_summary` pattern. Never comment-per-run; noise is why AI review
   workflows get disabled.
3. **Evidence or silence.** A claimed issue names the clause, the line, and
   the source text it conflicts with, or it is not posted.
4. **Checks earn their noise or get removed.** Rule-hit counts and review
   cycles are measured; anything that flags without changing outcomes is
   deleted.

## The layers

### L0. Author checklist

A "Before requesting review" section in
`FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/README.md`, distilled from corrections that
actually recur in review (each line traces to a real review comment on a
merged PR):

- Quote erdosproblems.com verbatim in docstrings; do not paraphrase unless
  fixing a genuine error in the original.
- For solved problems, also quote the attribution sentence below the box
  (who solved it, where) verbatim.
- Search `FormalConjecturesForMathlib` and neighboring problem files before
  defining anything; notation and API often already exist.
- Meta-commentary belongs in the PR description, not the Lean file.
- New attribute or utility behavior needs demo tests in
  `FormalConjecturesTest`.

Zero infrastructure. The welcome bot already points contributors at this
README.

### L1. Statement facts

A deterministic sticky comment on ErdosProblems PRs, computed in CI, facts
only:

- per declaration: `@[category]`, `@[AMS]`, docstring presence (the existing
  linters already enforce these; the comment surfaces them per-PR);
- agreement between the file's category and erdosproblems.com's live status
  (the logic already exists in `scripts/check_erdos_status.py`);
- for any `formal_proof` link: the linked proof's axiom set, `sorry` state,
  and the Prop hypotheses it takes as parameters, from the same extractor
  behind this repository's audit and
  [FC#4368](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/pull/4368).

This is the mechanical half of a review, precomputed. A reviewer opens the
PR and the facts are already on the table.

### L2. Behavioral probes

The strongest known fidelity checks act on the statement rather than reading
it ([Faithfulness Gap, arXiv:2606.16541](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16541):
LLM judges detected statement drift at 63%, behavioral probing at ~90%):

- **Trivial proof/disproof attempt.** Run a prover briefly against the
  statement and its negation. A genuinely open problem should survive both;
  a missing hypothesis usually does not. Precedent: Boris Alexeev's
  [Aristotle run on Erdős 56](https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2025/12/05/formalization-of-erdos-problems/),
  where a size-2 counterexample exposed a missing hypothesis instantly.
- **Suspicious-pattern linters.** Vacuous hypotheses, trivially-true shapes,
  inconsistent hypothesis sets, in the mold of the repo's existing
  `ExistsImplicationLinter` and `AnswerLinter`. These are the only two
  semantic misformalization linters deployed anywhere in the Lean ecosystem;
  the pattern is proven and extensible.

Probe results are flags in the L1 comment for the human reviewer. A flag is
a reason to look, never a verdict.

### L3. The screening check

For contested or high-stakes statements: a curated, model-assisted check in
the format Nat Sothanaphan developed for solution claims on
erdosproblems.com, adapted to statement fidelity. The procedure, with his
hygiene imported wholesale:

1. **Fresh session, always.** The checking model never shares context with
   whoever produced the statement; a model re-reading its own work is
   convinced by it.
2. **Triage, then audit.** Overview of the statement and source; rank the
   places most worth scrutinizing (quantifier order, hypothesis strength,
   definitional unfoldings, domain conventions); audit each; one full pass.
   No "be adversarial" instruction; demanding errors exist produces
   hallucinated ones.
3. **Per-clause correspondence table.** Every quantifier, hypothesis, and
   conclusion of the formal statement mapped to the source text, one verdict
   per clause. After correcting any misreading, re-verify all clauses, not
   just the corrected one.
4. **Verdict lexicon.** "Check **found** no mismatch" (absence of findings)
   vs "check **claimed** a mismatch in clause X" (positive reports are
   themselves unverified claims). Never "the statement is faithful."
5. **Transcript published** with every result, plus the fixed disclaimer:
   this is a screening, not comprehensive, and not a confirmation stamp.

Anyone can run one; documenting the format is what makes results comparable
across people and time. Known failure modes to design against: sycophancy
toward the artifact ([BrokenMath, arXiv:2510.04721](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04721));
correlated errors across model runs, so prefer flag-union with human
adjudication over majority voting (the FrontierMath v2 audit found errors in
42% of problems that had already passed human review); and circularity, the
check must read the original source, not the repo's own docstring.

### L4. The human signature

Unchanged, and the point. Maintainer approval remains the only thing that
merges a statement. In this repository's terms: the machine tier reports
facts, and a statement-fidelity verdict exists only as a named reviewer's
signed event. Nothing in L0–L3 signs anything.

## Phase 0: CI latency (measured)

Review cycles include waiting for CI, and the numbers say most of that wait
buys PRs nothing. `build-and-docs.yml` runs one job for both PR validation
and site deployment, and the deploy half runs on every PR even though the
deploy job itself is main-only. Step timings from two recent PR runs
(runs 28612552108 and 28608145267, 100 and 115 minutes):

| step | time | needed for a PR? |
|---|---|---|
| `lake --wfail build` (the actual gate) | ~28 min | yes |
| Verso literate source pages | **52–53 min** | no, deployed only from main |
| doc-gen documentation | 7–31 min (cache luck) | no |
| growth plots, stats, website build, Pages artifact | ~5 min | no |

So roughly **two thirds of every PR's CI is building artifacts the PR can
never deploy**. At 100+ runs of this workflow per week, that is on the order
of 100 wasted runner-hours weekly.

The cache design compounds it. The repository sits at GitHub's 10 GB cache
limit with LRU eviction, and every PR run saves its own olean and doc cache
under `refs/pull/N/merge`, where no other PR can restore it (GitHub scopes
cache reads to a branch and its base). Dozens of unreadable PR-scoped
entries crowd out the main-branch caches every other run needs, which is
consistent with the 28-minute "incremental" build and the 7-vs-31-minute
doc-build lottery.

Two small workflow changes, no behavior change on main:

1. Gate the literate/docs/plots/website/artifact steps on
   `github.event_name != 'pull_request'` (or split a `pr-build.yml` out of
   the deploy workflow). PR CI drops from ~100 to ~30 minutes.
2. Save caches only on main; restore everywhere. Main's caches stop being
   evicted by unreadable PR-scoped saves, so PR builds restore fresher
   oleans, which should pull the 28-minute build down further.

This is independent of everything below and is arguably the first PR to
make: it shortens every contributor's feedback loop, not just this
pipeline's.

## Rollout

**Phase 1, no infrastructure.** The L0 checklist as a small PR to the
ErdosProblems README, plus L3-format self-reviews posted on my own open
batch PRs so maintainers can judge from real artifacts whether the format
saves cycles. Costs the maintainers nothing but a read. Phase 0 (the CI
split) can ship in parallel; it needs only a workflow review.

**Phase 2, if Phase 1 reads as useful.** The L1 workflow behind a
`statement-check` label, run on ~10 PRs. Measure review cycles per merged
PR against the recent baseline. Adopt, adjust, or delete on the numbers.

**Phase 3, if Phase 2 pays.** L2 probes, added one at a time, each with its
own hit-rate ledger.

Kill criterion at every phase: anything that adds noise instead of removing
cycles goes.

## What this is not

- Not an AI reviewer. No model approves, requests changes, or gates.
- Not comment automation. One sticky comment, severity-floored, or nothing.
- Not a replacement for reading the mathematics. It clears the mechanical
  underbrush so the ten human minutes land on the judgment only a human can
  sign.
